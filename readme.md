This is a site designed to provide functionality to manage multiple GitHub repositories at the same time.

The intent is to provide:

Create/Edit Milestones and Labels for a group of repositories
View Pull requests and contributors to a group of repositories
View some stats for a group of repositories
	Issues without a milestone


This also has a goal of being a learning project. The functionality will be useful, but the way we go about it is not necesarilly the best way. We are building this in order to try things out, so some technology and architecture choices are deliberately designed to force a particular style of development or path that we want to explore.
